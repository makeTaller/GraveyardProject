        =======================================================================

	graveyard project- is an adpative media interface that registers social state over time. 
			

					%%%%%% Summary %%%%%%%
			 - currrently the leading social media sites use status with optional state information. Which makes it 
			   difficult datamine for meaning. I purpose a state information take presedence over status which coherses
			   users to focus on describing state information before status information.

			 - users can then observe themselves change overtime
			   	* insight to when events occurred
			 	* recognize observable patterns in day to day simulus 
				* suggest what one can do to improve states 

			  		 %%%%%% Interface %%%%%%

			 - grvp replaces emojii's with color wheels to set dials to describe state.
            		 	1. financial dial
				2. mental dial 
				3. spirital dial 
				4. physical dial 
				5. aspirational dial

			 - when a new state is registered, it is catagorized into  one or more catagories. 
			   ( This is where marketing, content producers, ads and users will focus thier attention.)

			 - content is now color coded and tagged for trait specific data.
			   ( A blue user watching red content suggest a variance in character profile)

			 - content is searched, added, and viewed like spokes onto your color wheel
			   ( Behavior - as you roll the dial your state will be set upon release)

			 -  we concern your state not your status.
			    we monitor your motivations rather your movement.
			    we challenge your goals not your mistakes.
			    we are the business class social media.

			 - users sell space to the public for liquidable credits.
